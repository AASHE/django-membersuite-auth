   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to aashe-python's documentation!
========================================

The aashe-python module contains a collection of useful Python code
for AASHE projects. The goal of this project is to build a reusable
set of modules that perform common AASHE-tasks.  Everything in
aashe-python should be designed to be independent of a specific
project.

The module currently contains mostly Django apps, but could include
anything as long as it is written to be used independently.
